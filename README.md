# Quay On OpenShift


Quay allows you to manage your container images securely and reliably. It supports multiple authentication provides, encrypted cli passwords, detailed logging and auditing, orginazations/teams, and a multitude of other enteprise grade functionality.

Quay is meant to work with any container environment or orchestration platform; therefore, it's ideal for OpenShift!

In this workshop we will install and configure Quay on OpenShift. We will also configure clair and other operational components. Let's get started!
