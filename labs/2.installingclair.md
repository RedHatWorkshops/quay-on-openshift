# Installing Clair

Clair is an open source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities in `appc` and `docker` containers. It's the default scanner for `quay`. 

Vulnerability data is continuously imported from a known set of sources and correlated with the indexed contents of container images in order to produce lists of vulnerabilities that threaten a container.

The following sections explain how to set up clair and connect it to quay.

## Set Up Quay

Under the admin panel, click on the gear icon to the left to reach the "Registry Settngs"


![clar-quay-reg-settings](images/quay-reg-settings.png)

Once here scroll down until you see `Security Scanner` and tick off `Enable Security Scanning`. In the `Security Scanner Endpoint` enter `http://clair:6060`. It should look like this.

To connect Quay Enterprise securely to the scanner, click `Create Key >` to create an authentication key between Quay and the Security Scanner. This will bring up a window, select `Generate shared key`


![clair-quay-key](https://coreos.com/quay-enterprise/docs/latest/img/security-scanner-generate-shared.png)

Enter an optional expiration date, and click `Generate Key`

![clair-quay-gnekey](https://coreos.com/quay-enterprise/docs/latest/img/security-scanner-generate-shared-dialog.png)

**Save the key ID** and download the preshared private key into your `$HOME` directory.

Now move on to setting up `clair`

## Setup Clair

Now, export some environment vars

```
export POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://quay:quay@postgresql:5432/clair?sslmode=disable"
export QUAY_ENDPOINT=$(oc get svc quay-enterprise -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name'})
export CLAIR_ENDPOINT=clair:6060
export CLAIR_SERVICE_KEY_ID=<your key id>
```

**NOTE** replace `<your key id>` with the key id you got from the quay config screen.


Download the clair config yaml template

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/quay-on-openshift/master/labs/resources/clair-config-TEMPLATE.yaml
```

Create a new config based on your env vars and this template

```
envsubst < clair-config-TEMPLATE.yaml > clair-config.yaml
```

Verify your changes with...

```
diff clair-config-TEMPLATE.yaml clair-config.yaml
```

Next, create the configmaps from the `clair-config.yaml` file you've just created and from the `security_scanner.pem` file you've downloaded into your `$HOME` dir.

```
cd ~/quaydeploy
mv $HOME/security_scanner.pem .
oc create configmap clair-config --from-file="config.yaml=clair-config.yaml"
oc create configmap security-scanner --from-file="security_scanner.pem=security_scanner.pem"
```

## Deploy Clair

Here, you will create the clair deployment using the `coreos-pull-secret` you created from the other lab. (OpenShift will use it by default)

```
oc new-app --name=clair -l app=clair quay.io/coreos/clair-jwt:v2.0.6
```

Next, mount the configmaps you created earlier

```
oc set volumes dc/clair --add --configmap-name=clair-config --type=configmap --mount-path=/config --overwrite
oc set volumes dc/clair --add --configmap-name=security-scanner --type=configmap --mount-path=/secscanerpem
```

Now that you've got clair set up...let's connect quay with clair

## Connecting Quay with Clair

Go back to your web browser (or open it again)

```
firefox http://quay.${ocproute}/superuser/?tab=setup
```

**NOTE**, you may have to login again

And under the `Security Scanner` make sure it says `http://clair:6060` under the `Security Scanner Endpoint` section. Note that it says ` Valid key for service security_scanner exists`. This is a good sign, click `Save Configuration Changes` on the bottom left.

It will go into a `Validating settings` screen. Once complete it should look like this...

Click on `Save Configuration`, and you're done!
