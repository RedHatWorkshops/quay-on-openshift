# Installing Clair

Clair is an open source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities in `appc` and `docker` containers. It's the default scanner for `quay`. 

Vulnerability data is continuously imported from a known set of sources and correlated with the indexed contents of container images in order to produce lists of vulnerabilities that threaten a container.

The following sections explain how to set up clair and connect it to quay.

## Set Up Quay
