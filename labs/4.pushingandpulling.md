# Pushing and Pulling Images

Now that you have a user with an organization in place; you can now push and pull in to this repo. You can also manages who has access to what repo based on the teams in your organization.

## Creating a Repository

First thing you have to do is login to this new repo.

```
firefox http://quay.${ocproute}/repository
```

Once logged in, click on the right had side on your organization, in my case, I clicked on `marketing`

![images-marketing](images/image-marketing.png)

On this page it will say `This namespace doesn't have any viewable repositories.`. Click on `creating a new repository`

![images-marketing](images/image-create-repo.png)

Once you've clicked that, you'll see the `Create New Repository` page. Here fill in the name as `welcome-php` and leave the access as `Private` (which is the default if you're doing it from the command line). It should look like this...

![images-marketing](images/repo-new-welcome.png)

Now click on `Create Private Repository`

## Push an Image to the repo

For this section, I will be pulling an image from the hostend Quay and then pushing it into this private instance. I will be using `podman` but the same commands will work if you're using docker


***NOTE*** You need to add your quay's domain name as an insecure registry. (This process may differ depending on what you're running on your client.

For example
```
$ sudo grep -B1 quay /etc/containers/registries.conf
[registries.insecure]
registries = ['quay.apps.54.241.70.195.nip.io']
```

Once you've gotten that set up, pull the `quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php` image to your local machine.

```
$ podman pull quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php

```

Now  check to see if you have the image locally...it should look like this

```
$ podman images
REPOSITORY                            TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php   latest   b57beebcb38c   5 weeks ago   592 MB
```

Now login to your Quay instance using the cli as `user1` (the user who has access to the `marketing` org)

```
$ podman login quay.${ocproute}
Username: user1
Password: *******
Login Succeeded!
```

Now tag the image to prepare it to be pushed/uploaded...

```
podman tag quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:latest quay.${ocproute}/marketing/welcome-php:latest
```

Now push this up to your instance

```
$ podman push quay.${ocproute}/marketing/welcome-php:latest

You've successfully pushed an image into your quay instance!

## Pull an Image from the repo

To test this, we will first delete the images (**WARNING** the following command will delete ALL your local images...use with caution)

```
podman rmi --force $(podman images -q)
```

Also logout of your instance

```
podman logout quay.${ocproute}
```

You should now not have the `welcome-php` in your local machine

```
$ podman images
$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE  COMMAND  CREATED  STATUS  PORTS  NAMES
```

Try pulling the image...you should see an `unauthorized` error message

```
$ podman pull quay.${ocproute}/marketing/welcome-php:latest
Trying to pull quay.apps.54.241.70.195.nip.io/marketing/welcome-php:latest...Failed

```

Now login as `user1`

```
$ podman login -u user1 quay.${ocproute}

## Verifying Clair scan

Clair, by default, scans all images for vulnerabilites. This is queued up as soon as the push finishes. Open up your browser to the `marketing` organization and login as `user1`

```
firefox quay.${ocproute}/organization/marketing
```

Once logged in, you should see this page

![scan-mkt-splash](images/scan-marketing-splash.png)

Once you're here click on the `welcome-php` repo you just pushed into.

![scan-repo-splash](images/repo-overview-wphp.png)

On this page click on the tag icon ![tag](images/tag.png) on the left hand side. This will bring up the tag overview page. Here you can see the image has been scanned and issues have been found. 

![scan-repo-splash](images/scanned.png)

Click on the `12 high` (number might differ on yours) link to see an overview page. Feel free to browse around and see the issues and their fixes.

![scan-repo-splash](images/vulnerable.png)

That's it! you can continue on to [Assigning Users to Teams](5.userstoteams.md)
