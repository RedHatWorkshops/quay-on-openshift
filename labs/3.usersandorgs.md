# Creatings Users and Organizations

In this Lab we will be creating a user and an organization.

Organizations provide a way of sharing repositories under a common namespace that does not belong to a single user, but rather to many users in a shared setting (such as a company).

Organizations are further broken down into a set of Teams which provide access to a subset of the repositories under that namespace


# Creating A User

Open up the 


```
firefox http://quay.${ocproute}/superuser/
```


This should bring up the Admin console and the "users" tab should already be selected. The screen should look like this

In this dialog box, enter...

* `Username` - Enter `user1`
* `Email address` - Enter `user1-quayworkshop@mailinator.com`

Click on `Create User` button when done.

This will bring up a screen that shows the temporary password

On the right hand side, click `Create New Oragnization`

In the next screen enter a name for this organization; I used `marketing` as an example

Click `Create Organization` to create it.

Once created; it'll drop you into the Organization Settings page

Now that you have a organization...it's time to create a team!

While still on the Organization overview page, click on the "Teams and Memebership" logo ![teams-and-mem](images/team-logo.png) on the left hand side to bring up the overview page.

Click on `Create New Team` and give it a name. I will use `developers`

Once you've filled out the name, click on `Create team`

That's it! You can go ahead to [Pushing and Pulling images](4.pushingandpulling.md)
